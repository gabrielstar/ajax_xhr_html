# ajax_xhr_html
An example simple app with AJAX requests to API and DOM rendering to be used to demonstrate jmeter and selenium problems

I recommend using Netbeans to use the project as it has good out of the box support for JS.

This project contains a simple index.html page and ajax script that registers one event. When event is fired data from API endpoint is rendered in DOM.

This is a simple standalone app that server as playground against jmeter and selenium scripts to demomnstrate AJAX challanges
